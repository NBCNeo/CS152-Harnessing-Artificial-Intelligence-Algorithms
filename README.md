# CS152: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Algorithms
Selected assignments and coding exercises from the class CS152: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. The notebooks may contain terms or concepts that targeted the description of the assignment or Minerva's grading structure. Such secttions should not prevent the reader from capturing the code structure. 

For the most organized and well-implemented example, refer to [Assignment 2 - The DPLL Algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS152-Harnessing-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms/blob/master/Assignment%202%20-%20The%20DPLL%20Algorithm.ipynb). For a slightly larger project, but with a less tidy implementation due to time constraints during execution, check out an implementation of an Backgammon AI player based on the Expectiminimax algorith with alpha-beta pruning on non-chance nodes [here](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS152-Harnessing-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms/blob/master/Backgammon%20Player%20-%20Expectiminimax%20with%20Alpha-Beta%20Pruning.ipynb). An accompanying report is also available [here](https://github.com/viniciusmss/CS152-Harnessing-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms/blob/master/Backgammon%20Player%20Report.pdf).
